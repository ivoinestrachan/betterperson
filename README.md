# Productivity Extension 
Are you always procrastinating?
Yeah me too, procrastinating often leads to an increase in stress and anxiety, as well as the likelihood of making errors when rushing toward the completion of a project. In worst-case scenarios, putting things off until the last minute can cause you to miss an important deadline.
We do this a lot as programmers so I decided to create something to help us to stop procrastinating and be more productive.
